## Multicolor Calibration technique for gravitational wave detectors
We are developing a new calibration method for gravitational wave detectors utilizing the co-resonating frequency doubled green laser in the arms. We'll demonstrate our method at the 40m prototype at Caltech, where we are aiming to reach 0.1 % uncertainty in detector absolute calibration. This work would allow future LIGO detectors to not be limited by calibration noise even for strong signals.


## Cryogenic interferometer lock acquisition and calibration
We are developing a lock acquisition scheme for future cryogenic gravitational wave detectors like LIGO Voyager. Advanced LIGO currently used a frequency-doubled 532 nm green laser to assist in locking five cross-coupled cavities with the main laser at 1064 nm. Since cryogenic Si test mass requires a higher operation wavelength ($$ \sim $$ 2 $$ \mu $$m), we are working on using an optical frequency comb to compare with any arbitrary auxiliary wavelength for lock acquisition. We plan to cancel the intrinsic noise of the frequency comb using a feedforward technique employing a Direct Digital Synthesizer. In the future, the same subsystem can be used for calibrating the detector as well.


## Balanced Homodyne Readout at 40m Prototype
We are implementing Balanced Homodyne Readout at the 40m prototype at Caltech to test and characterize this method as a gravitational wave readout scheme. This method has not been implemented on a suspended interferometer before. I led a team of three postdocs, one research scientist, and two graduate students, to upgrade the entire optical layout of 40m, involving adding 7 new suspensions to existing set of 10 suspended optics, and new low noise controls and data acquisition electronics. This is the most major upgrade to the lab in last 12 years.


## Direct measurement of Coatings Brownian Noise for Crystalline Coatings
Brownian noise at the high reflectivity Bragg coatings in LIGO mirrors persists to be the dominant noise contributor in 200 Hz to 600 Hz frequency range. Our understanding of the theory of origin of this noise remains untested and incomplete. I worked on a table top optical setup to measure the coatings Brownian noise of thermo-optic optimized GaAs/AlGaAs mirrors down to $$10^{-18}$$ m/$$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$$ at 100 Hz. The results of the experiment inform us on our gaps in noise estimation of the coating BRrownian noise using mechanical loss angle which is measured indirectly.
