I was born and raised in the central part of India. I got my education up to
undergraduate degree in India and then moved to united states.

I love nature, animals, and plants and one of the biggest goals of my life is
to have a positive impact on nature through working on mitigating climate
change and adopting sustainable and environment friendly practices.
