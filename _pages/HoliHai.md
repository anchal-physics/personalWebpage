Holi is the celebration of all the colors in this world. It is that time of the year when you take a break from your restricted ultra-clean grey life and appreciate the beauty of colors in your life. For once, you stop caring about getting stained or wet and let go. In the Holi arena, nobody gets upset, nobody gets angry and nobody stops enjoying üôÇ. A very common saying on the day is, ‚ÄúBura na mano, Holi Hai!‚Äù (Don‚Äôt get sad, it's Holi!).

Feel free to google more about this awesome Indian festival. We'll play Holi at my awesome friends‚Äô place, also colloquially known as the commie house. We‚Äôll play Holi with dry colors that are created from natural, edible, and biodegradable material (mostly corn starch and flower petals)
and colored water (colored with non-toxic washable temporary color). I‚Äôll arrange for some Indian cuisine lunch (would be mostly vegan and vegetarian) and there will be drinks. Traditionally, some people play Holi with edibles, some options would be available. Feel free to bring your own stuff too.

## Rules

There are no rules except
* Inside the house, please walk only on the black plastic-covered floor only. Other areas will be out of bounds.
* If you are entering the backyard where people are playing, expect to get wet and/or stained without being asked for your consent explicitly. If you really do not want that, I think it is better to not come.
* Having said that, of course when you are playing, play with some responsibility so that people do not feel uncomfortable and everyone can enjoy. Take care about stuff getting inside the eyes, nose, and mouth. The colors would be non-toxic and edible but you won't like the taste.
* Also, if you prefer to stay dry, I have seen people self-organize in these events so that there is a dry play area and there is a wet playing area.
* DO NOT wear contact lenses if you use them. Wear glasses, they would also save your eyes better.
* I might update these, so please recheck before coming.

## Preparation suggestions:

* Come in old white or light-colored clothes. Remember though, you might get wet.
* Wear comfortable washable or waterproof footwear. I recommend crocs, jute sandals, or rubber sleepers.
* Feel free to bring a change of clothes which you can wear out later. Changing rooms will be available.
* Have a light breakfast for some energy before coming. But remember, lunch will be provided.
* Please avoid driving to the event. Parking would be a problem and I do not want designated drivers not enjoying it fully. Try using public transport.
