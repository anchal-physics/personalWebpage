Welcome to my webpage

I am a graduate student of physics at California Institute of Technology. I
am an experimental physicist and have been working with developing future
gravitational wave detectors during my graduate school. My primary interests
are precision measurements and control systems and feedback in optical,
mechanical, and electronic systems.

My PhD defense talk is scheduled for May 15, 2023 at Noon at Downs-Lauritsen 107.
