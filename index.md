Welcome to my webpage

I am a graduate student of physics at California Institute of Technology. I am
an experimental physicist and have been working on developing experimental
methods for future gravitational wave detection during my graduate school. My
primary interests are precision measurements and control systems and feedback
in optical, mechanical, and electronic systems.

I successfully defended my thesis on May 15, 2023. You can find my [thesis here](https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-001004673).

I have accepted a position at the General Atomics Research Participation
Program, DIII-D National Fusion Facility, San Diego. I'll be shifting gears and
working on plasma control systems in superconducting Tokamaks for power generation through controlled nuclear fusion.
