Welcome to my webpage

I am a graduate student of physics at California Institute of Technology. I am
an experimental physicist and have been working on developing experimental
methods for future gravitational wave detection during my graduate school. My
primary interests are precision measurements and control systems and feedback
in optical, mechanical, and electronic systems.

My PhD defense talk is scheduled for May 15, 2023 at Noon at Room 107 in [Downs-Lauritsen Laboratory of Physics, Caltech](https://goo.gl/maps/gYSoq8x31P8L33hd7).
