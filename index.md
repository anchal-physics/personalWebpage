Welcome to my webpage

I am a graduate student of physics at California Institute of Technology. I
am an experimental physicist and have been working with developing future
gravitational wave detectors during my graduate school. My primary interests
are precision measurements and control systems and feedback in optical,
mechanical, and electronic systems.
