Welcome to my webpage

I am
an experimental physicist and have worked on developing experimental
methods for improving future gravitational wave detection during my graduate school. My
primary interests are precision measurements and control systems and feedback
in optical, mechanical, and electronic systems.

I successfully defended my thesis on May 15, 2023. You can find my [thesis here](https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-001004673).

Currently I am working at General Atomics, San Diego as an Oak Ridge Associated
Universities Postdoctoral Scholar. My new research focus is on plasma control systems
in superconducting Tokamaks for power generation through controlled nuclear fusion.
